# Question: How do you solve the frog jump problem across stones with dynamic programming? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `canCross(stones)` is designed to solve the frog jump problem using dynamic programming. The problem involves a frog that can jump across stones in a river, with the jump distance either staying the same, increasing by one, or decreasing by one with each jump. The function takes an array of integers representing the positions of the stones in the river. It first checks if the second stone is at position 1, if not, it returns false as the frog cannot reach it. It then creates a dynamic programming (dp) array of sets, where each set will store the possible jump distances that can reach the corresponding stone. The function then iterates over the stones, and for each stone, it checks all previous stones to calculate the jump distance needed to reach the current stone from each previous stone. If this distance, or one less, or one more, is in the set of possible jump distances for a previous stone, it adds the calculated distance to the set for the current stone. Finally, it checks if there are any possible jump distances for the last stone. If there are, it returns true, indicating that the frog can reach the last stone. If not, it returns false. This solution efficiently uses dynamic programming to track all possible jump distances at each stone, and determine if the frog can reach the last stone.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall logic and approach to solving the problem. Both versions use dynamic programming to keep track of all possible jump distances at each stone and determine if the frog can reach the last stone.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. Class-based approach: The TypeScript version uses a class-based approach, defining a `FrogJump` class with a `canCross` method. This is more in line with object-oriented programming principles and can make the code more organized and easier to manage, especially in larger codebases.

2. Type annotations: TypeScript allows for type annotations, which can help catch errors at compile-time. In the TypeScript version, the `canCross` method is explicitly annotated to take an array of numbers (`stones: number[]`) and return a boolean (`boolean`).

3. Different dynamic programming implementation: The JavaScript version uses an array of sets (`dp`) to keep track of the possible jump distances at each stone, while the TypeScript version uses a 2D boolean array (`dp`). The TypeScript version also includes an additional check at the beginning to return false if the distance between any two consecutive stones is greater than the index of the second stone, which is not present in the JavaScript version.

4. Different iteration logic: The JavaScript version iterates from the second stone to the last stone, and for each stone, it iterates from the first stone to the current stone. The TypeScript version, on the other hand, iterates from the first stone to the last stone, and for each stone, it iterates from the current stone to the first stone in reverse order. This difference in iteration logic does not affect the final result, but it may affect the performance of the solution.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also uses dynamic programming to solve the frog jump problem, similar to the JavaScript version. However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in both versions.

1. Data Structures: In the JavaScript version, an array of Sets is used to keep track of all possible jump distances at each stone. In contrast, the C++ version uses a 2D vector (analogous to a 2D array) to store the same information. The use of Set in JavaScript allows for efficient checking of whether a certain jump distance exists or not, while in C++, direct indexing is used for the same purpose.

2. Loop Structure: Both versions use nested loops to iterate over the stones and calculate the possible jump distances. However, the order of the loops and the conditions are slightly different. In the JavaScript version, the outer loop starts from the second stone, while the inner loop starts from the first stone. In the C++ version, the outer loop starts from the first stone, and the inner loop starts from the zeroth stone.

3. Condition Checking: In the JavaScript version, the condition to add a jump distance to the set for a stone is if the jump distance, or one less or one more than the jump distance exists in the set for the previous stone. In the C++ version, the condition is slightly different. It checks if the jump distance is not less than -1 and not more than the index of the current stone. If it is within this range, it checks if the jump distance, or one less or one more than the jump distance exists in the 2D vector for the previous stone.

4. Return Value: In the JavaScript version, the function returns true if the set for the last stone has any elements in it, otherwise it returns false. In the C++ version, the function iterates over the last row of the 2D vector and returns true if it finds any true value, otherwise it returns false.

5. Output: In JavaScript, the result is directly logged to the console. In C++, the result is printed to the standard output using `std::cout`. The ternary operator is used to print "True" if the function returns true, and "False" otherwise.
