Here is a TypeScript solution for the frog jump problem using dynamic programming:

```typescript
class FrogJump {
    canCross(stones: number[]): boolean {
        let n = stones.length;
        let dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => new Array(n).fill(false));
        dp[0][0] = true;

        for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (stones[i] - stones[i - 1] > i) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                let k = stones[i] - stones[j];
                if (k > j + 1) {
                    break;
                }
                dp[i][k] = dp[j][k - 1] || dp[j][k] || dp[j][k + 1];
                if (i === n - 1 && dp[i][k]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}

let frogJump = new FrogJump();
console.log(frogJump.canCross([0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17]));  // true
console.log(frogJump.canCross([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11]));  // false
```

This program defines a class `FrogJump` with a method `canCross` that takes an array of stone positions and returns whether the frog can cross the river by jumping on the stones. The `canCross` method uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first checks if the distance between any two consecutive stones is greater than the index of the second stone. If so, it returns false because the frog cannot make such a jump. Then it iterates over the stones and for each stone, it checks if the frog can reach it by jumping from a previous stone with a jump size of `k`, `k - 1`, or `k + 1`. If the frog can reach the last stone, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. The program then creates an instance of `FrogJump` and tests the `canCross` method with two test cases.
